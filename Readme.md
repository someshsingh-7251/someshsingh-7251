#  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Somesh Singh!

## About Me

As a 3rd-year BTech Computer Science student with hands-on experience in both sales and technology, I bring a unique combination of technical knowledge and business acumen. Currently, I  worked as a Sales Executive at Supply Buggy and leading as the Sales Manager at Singhâ€™s Arena, where I focus on delivering results-driven strategies to enhance customer engagement and streamline sales processes.

In addition to my sales expertise, Iâ€™ve completed internships at Cavendish Industries Limited (A unit of JK Tyre), specializing in SAP software, and at Oasis Infobyte, focusing on Web Development and Designing. These experiences have given me strong skills in SAP ERP systems, front-end development, and problem-solving, enabling me to approach challenges from both a technical and strategic perspective.

My goal is to bridge the gap between business and technology, leveraging my sales experience and technical knowledge to drive growth and innovation in every role I take on. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, adapt, and take on new challenges.
